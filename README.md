##1. - Introduction

The following code is written for a programming assignment at Reykjav√≠k University for the class T-504-ITML - Introduction to Machine learning.
It focuses on implementing different EA algorithms, as well as different
approaches for solving them using crossovers, mutation, selection etc.

This code is published under the GNU GPL.
