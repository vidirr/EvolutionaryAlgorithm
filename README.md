<a name="intro" />
##1. - Introduction

The following code is written for a programming assignment at Reykjav√≠k University for the class T-504-ITML - Introduction to Machine learning.
It focuses on implementing different EA algorithms, as well as different
approaches for solving them using crossovers, mutation, selection etc.

This code is published under the GNU GPL.

<a name="install" />
##2. - Installation

Installing the suite is as simple as cloning the repo and running EA_main.py [name_of_test]. The example test configurations can be found inside config.ini.


<code>git clone https://www.github.com/vidirr/EvolutionaryAlgorithm</code>


<a name="run" />
##3. - Running the program

The program is initiated from the commandline, where the name of the test to be run is passed as a argument.

###3.i - Configuration File
Example configuration:
<code>
[f1_1]                                   ;EA name
POPULATION_SIZE = 100
RANGE_MIN = -5.12                       ;Min range for test function
RANGE_MAX = 5.11                        ;Max range for test function
N = 1                                   ;Population size
TEST_FUNCTION = F1                      ;F1, F2, Shekel, Rana
ITERATIONS = 100                        ;Number of iterations the algorithm runs through
SELECTION_SCHEME = Tournament           ;Roulette, Tournament, RankBiased
CROSSOVER_TYPE = TwoPoint               ;OnePoint, TwoPoint
MUTATION_RATE = 0.01                    ;Mutation rate
REPLACEMENT_METHOD = Generational       ;Generational, Elitism
MESSAGE = Solving De Jong F1 problem..
